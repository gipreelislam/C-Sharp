# Core LINQ
**Fluent API** : 
- Method Chaining and Extension method to make statement look like a sentence
- is code that reads as a sentence
**LINQ** : Language Integrated Query
- type safe queries
- query to object `IEnumerable<T>` _(not generic `IEnumerable`)_
- LINQ to remote SQL `iQueryable<T>`
- Set of Query Operator `Extension Methods`

Instead of creating our custom method
```csharp
public static IEnumerable<Employee> Filter
	(this IEnumerable<Employee> source, Predicate<Employee>) {..}
```
We Can rely on LINQ
```csharp
public static IEnumerable<TSource> Where<TSource>
	(this IEnumerable<TSource> source, Predicate<TSource>) {..}
```
## Ways to Write LINQ statements
Write LINQ statements using
#### Method Syntax
1. Extension method
```csharp
var result = numbers.Where(x => x % 2 == 0);
```
2. Enumerable Method <br> _( both Extension method and Query Syntax convert into it in IL language )_
```csharp
var result = Enumerable.Where(numbers, x => x % 2 == 0);
```
#### 3. Query Syntax
Compiler convert it to `Method Syntax`
```csharp
var result = from n in numbers // Range
			 where n % 2 == 0  // Filter
			 select n;         // Select
```
---
`evenNums` kept in memory as a expression act as wrapper containing reference to the `numbers` and `Where` Decorator, so every edit on the `source` before enumeration Taken into consideration 
```csharp
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
// Construction (lazy loading)
var evenNums = numbers.Where(x => x % 2 == 0);
numbers.Add(6);
// enumeration (immediate execution)
foreach (var e in evenNums)
    Console.WriteLine(e);
    // 2, 4, 6
```

## `IEnumerable` vs. `IQueryable`
### `IEnumerable`

> [!NOTE]  
> LINQ to Objects
> which mostly just does literally what it is told
> ex : if you sort then pages, then it sorts then pages, and vice versa

```csharp
var query_IEnumerable = deck.Shuffle()
	.Where(x => x.Value > 5).Skip(5).OrderBy(x => x.Value)
	.ThenByDescending(x => x.Suite).Take(5).AsEnumerable();
```
### `IQueryable`

> [!NOTE]  
> LINQ to SQL
> Query is being composed (Expression Tree)
> When Execute, Provider inspect your query tree
> build the most suitable implementation possible

```csharp
var query_IQueryable = deck.Shuffle()
	.Where(x => x.Value > 5).Skip(5).OrderBy(x => x.Value)
	.ThenByDescending(x => x.Suite).Take(5).AsQueryable();
```
---
## LINQ Execution
### Execution Order

> [!NOTE]  
> left to right as all Expressions in `C#`
> fetches matching items `on demand`
> `IEnumerable`, `foreach` and `yield` are not returned at once but one at a time

```csharp
var numbers = new int[] {8, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, 12, 9};
```

```csharp
var query = numbers
	.Where(x => x > 5)
	.Select(x => x * x)
	.Where(x => x % 6 == 0)
	.Take(2)
```

```plaintext
Where(8 > 5) => True
	Select(8 X 8) => 64
		Where(64 % 6) == 0 => False
Where(2 > 5) => False
Where(3 > 5) => False
Where(4 > 5) => False
Where(1 > 5) => False
Where(6 > 5) => True
	Select(6 X 6) => 36
		Where(36 % 6) == 0 => True (Take: 36)
Where(5  > 5) => False
Where(12 > 5) => True
	Select(12 X 12) => 144
		Where(144 % 6) == 0 => True (Take: 144)
```

### Two Types of Execution
#### Immediate Execution
the data source is read and the operation is performed at the point in the code where the query is declared
`not up to date` `not expensive to call` `list are big`
#### Deferred Execution
not executed when constructed, only when it's enumerated
setting up a data structure that describes the query
queries are `up to date` `expensive to call` `tiny`
##### Streaming
at the time of execution they do not read all source data before the yield element
where fetches matching items on demand
```csharp
var query = numbers
	.Where(x => x > 5)
	.Select(x => x * x)
	.Where(x => x % 6 == 0)
	.Take(2)
```
##### Non-Streaming
this is a sequence that has had an ordering operation applied to it 
where fetches matching all items
```csharp
var query = numbers
	.Where(x => x > 5)
	.OrderBy(x => x) // Buffering: 8, 6, 7, 9
	.Select(x => x * x)
	.Where(x => x % 6 == 0)
	.Take(2)
```
