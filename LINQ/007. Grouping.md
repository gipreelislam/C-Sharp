# Grouping
## Group By
- Uses deferred execution
- Each iterate `=>` group again
- `IEnumerable<IGrouping<TKey, TSource>>`
- Used in Single Process

```csharp
var groups = employees.GroupBy(x => x.Department);

var query  = from emp in employees
			 group emp by emp.Department;
```
## To Lookup
- Uses immediate execution
- buffer the result in memory
- `ILookup<TKey, TSource>`
- Used in Multiple Process

```csharp
var groups = employees.ToLookup(x => x.Department);
```
## Using

```csharp
foreach(var g in groups)
{
	Console.WriteLine(g.Key);
	foreach(var e in g)
		Console.WriteLine(e);
}
```
