### Sorting
there are two variations `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`
```csharp
var result01 = employees.OrderBy(x => x.Id);

var result04 = from employee in employees
               orderby employee.Id descending
               select employee;

```
### Primary And Secondary Sorting
there are two variations `ThenBy`, `ThenByDescending`
```csharp
var result02 = employees
	.OrderBy(x => x.FName)
	.ThenBy(x => x.LName);
```
### Custom Sorting

```csharp
var result03 = employees
	.OrderBy(x => x, new EmployeeComparer());
```

>[!INFO]
>We Implement a user defined class `EmployeeComparer` which inherit the `IComparer<Employee>`
### Reverse

```csharp
employees.Reverse();
```

>[!TIP]
>In last `Reverse()` function used to return `IEnumerable<T>` but now it returns `void` and sorting the source
