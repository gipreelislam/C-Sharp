# Joining
### Join
Joins two sequences based on key selector functions and extracts pairs of values.
```csharp
// Query Syntax
var query = from emp in employees
            join dept in departments on emp.DepartmentID equals dept.ID
            select new EmployeeDto
            {
                 ID = emp.ID,
                 Name = $"{emp.FirstName} {emp.LastName}",
                 DeptName = dept.Name
            };
// Method Syntax
var result = employees.Join(
    departments,
    emp => emp.DepartmentID, dept => dept.ID,
    (emp, dept) => new EmployeeDto
    {
        ID = emp.ID,
        Name = $"{emp.FirstName} {emp.LastName}",
        DeptName = dept.Name
    }
);
```
### Group Join
Joins two sequences based on key selector functions and groups the resulting matches for each element.
```csharp
var result = departments.GroupJoin(
	employees,
	dept => dept.ID, emp => emp.DepartmentID,
    (dept, emps) => new Department_Employees_Group
    {
        DeptName = dept.Name,
        Employees = emps.ToList()
    }
);

var query = from dept in departments
            join emp in employees on dept.ID equals emp.DepartmentID
            into empGroup
            select empGroup;
```
